# Handling Textual Data: Sentiment Analysis Approach

## 1. Introduction
This project explores methods to handle textual data effectively, using sentiment analysis as a case study. The workflow includes text preprocessing, feature extraction using TF-IDF, and training machine learning models: Naïve Bayes and Random Forest.

## 2. Text Preprocessing
To prepare text data for model training, several preprocessing steps were applied:

### 2.1 Lowercasing
All text was converted to lowercase to ensure uniformity.

### 2.2 Removing Punctuation
Punctuation marks were removed to reduce noise.

### 2.3 Removing Stopwords
Common stopwords were removed to focus on meaningful words.

### 2.4 Spelling Correction
Misspelled words were corrected using TextBlob.

### 2.5 Lemmatization
Words were reduced to their base form using lemmatization.

### 2.6 Removing Emojis
Emojis were removed to avoid non-textual influences.

## 3. Feature Extraction (TF-IDF Vectorization)
After preprocessing, the text was transformed into numerical form using TF-IDF.

## 4. Model Training
Two machine learning models were trained on the vectorized data.

### 4.1 Naïve Bayes Classifier
A Multinomial Naïve Bayes model was used for classification.

### 4.2 Random Forest Classifier
A Random Forest model was also trained for comparison.

## 5. Model Evaluation
Both models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## 6. Conclusion
This project demonstrates techniques for handling textual data, using sentiment analysis as a practical application. The next steps could involve hyperparameter tuning, dataset expansion, and testing deep learning models.
